THIS IS A LIST OF NEARLY ALL THE PROGRAMS I HAVE INSTALLED IN MY COMPUTER
I HAVE MADE THIS LIST SO I CAN LOOK UP WHAT PROGRAMS AND PACKAGES I HAD
INSTALLED IN MY COMPUTER AND INSTALL THEM AFTER I FORMAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACCESORY
--------

Docky
|\This is a program that puts a little dock in the desktop so you can
||launch and see what programs are active
||You can install it via PPA:
||add-apt-repository ppa:docky-core/stable
||or
||add-apt-repository ppa:docky-core/ppa
||With the first one you can get the stable version of docky, and with
||the second one the development version of docky. I have the second.

Gjiten
|\A japanese dictionary for linux, but it hasn't been updated for years
||now. You can find and add updated dictionaries, though.

Redshift
|\This is a little utility that changes the temperature of the screen
||during the day so that it doesn't annoy you.
||It also have a PPA:
||add-apt-repository ppa:jonls/redshift-ppa





SCIENCE PROGRAMS AND RELATED
----------------------------

QtiPlot
|\A program similar to Origin but free that can be used to analize data
||plot graphs, fix data to functions and that kind of scientific things (^_')
||If you google "QtiPlot PPA" it says that there is a PPA:
||add-apt-repository ppa:showard314/qtiplot-ppa
||But it doesn't work right now.

Stellarium
|\This is a program that can be used to know the position of stars and
||planets in the sky at any time. It has a really big database, and you
||can download even bigger ones.
